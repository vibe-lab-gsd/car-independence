# Notes on literature review

This is my literature review.

The focus here is:

1. Identifying other research that has used the ratio of non-car to car accessibilty as a metric (or something similar).
2. Identifying research that can justify the use of that metric.

## Defining accessibility

Some articles that define accessibility are Handy and Niemiere...(@handy1997measuring). 

The ease with which any land-use activity can be reached from a location using a particular transport system (@Dalvi1976TheMO)

The freedom of individuals to  decide whether or not to participate in different activities (@Burns1979TransportationTA)

Difference between the access and accessibility- 
*  Access is used when talking about a person’s perspective, accessibility when using a location’s perspective.(@Geurs2004)



## Measuring accessiblity

1. It proposed a location-based measure of accessibility to urban functions and to employment.(@Benenson2011)
* based on the estimate of the  travel time between (O)rigin and (D)estination; Transpor tation (M)ode: public (B)us, and private (C)ar.
*  Cartravel time (CTT):  = Walk time from origin to the parking place  + Car trip time + Walk time from the final parking place to destination
*
2. (@Geurs2004)distinguish between four types of accessibility  measures:
* Infrastructure-based measures- the performance or service level of transport infrastructure (e.g. ‘the average travel speed on the road network’)
* Location-based measures, which provide insight in the accessibility of locations  (e.g. ‘the number of jobs within 30 min travel from origin locations’)
* Person-based measures-accessibility at the individual level taking into account personal possibilities and constraints (‘the number of activities where an individual can participate’)
* Utility-basedmeasures,analyzingthe(economic) benefits that people derive from access to the spatially distributed activities

3. (@Liao2022) This study evaluates disparities in travel time between private car (car) and public transport (PT).
* They developed a ratio metric- Travel Time Ratio (TTR) to compare PT to car performance 
TTR = PT travel time / Car travel time

* Temporal and Spatial Sensitivity
t=The travel time disparity, as quantified by the travel time ratio R (pt travel time divided by the car travel time), varies widely during an average weekday, by location and time of day.

## Importance of accessbility
In order to address transport-related environmental impacts through transportation planning and policy, it is necessary to assess the scale and quality of transport alternatives available to people.(@Benenson2011)

From an equity perspective, too, a comparison between accessibility for different transport modes is required

Car-free VS Car less
In (@brown2017a) talks about the nuanced two concepts
Car-free individuals make more trips per day and rely more on public transit, biking, and walking.
Car-free households choose not to own cars, often for environmental, lifestyle, or urban convenience reasons.
Car-less households lack cars due to economic or situational constraints (e.g., low income, unemployment, disability).
Car-less individuals make fewer trips overall, often due to limited mobility options and poorer transit access.
