# Notes on literature review

This is my literature review.

The focus here is:

1. Identifying other research that has used the ratio of non-car to car accessibilty as a metric (or something similar).
2. Identifying research that can justify the use of that metric.

## Defining accessibility

Some articles that define accessibility are Handy and Niemiere...(@handy1997measuring). Hand

## Measuring accessiblity

Here are some bullet points

*  A location-based measure of accessibility to urban functions and to employment. 
*  based on the estimate of the  travel time between (O)rigin and (D)estination. We define them for a given transpor tation (M)ode: public (B)us, and private (C)ar.
*  *  Cartravel time (CTT): 
 CTT = Walktimefromorigin to the parking place  + Car trip time + Walk time from the final parking place to destination
